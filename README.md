## Introduction
In this paper we propose the Maximal Average Shift (MAS) algorithm that finds a pattern scan order that maximizes the average shift length. We also present two extensions of MAS: one improves the scan speed of MAS by using the scan result of the previous window, and the other improves the running time of MAS by using $q$-grams. These algorithms show better average performances in scan speed than previous string matching algorithms for DNA sequences.
